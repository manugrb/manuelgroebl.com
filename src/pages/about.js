                    <TextParagraph>I am interested in many things. Mainly technology, sience, math and travelling. <br/>
                    Obviously i really like programming, but I also like learning new things about computer hardware, as well as electrical engeneering. I believe in open source software and privacy. That's why I am always trying to move the open source community further (for example by spreading the word or developing open source software).<br/>
                    Concerning science, I am mostly interested in physics (especially theoretical physics).<br/>
                    I am also travelling the world right now. I've visited quite a few countries in Europe and Asia. So if you need any travel advice, just hit me up and maybe I can help you out.</TextParagraph>
