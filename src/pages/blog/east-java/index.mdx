    According to many big traveling websites and youtube videos, east Java is supposed to be the best part of Java for travelers. But does it actually live up to its hype? Let's find out!

    More specifically we are going to talk about Malang, Mount Bromo, Kawah Ijen and Surabaya, since those are the places I visited in East Java.

    ## About East Java
    East Java (*Java Timur*) is the easternmost province on Java. It borders Central Java in the west. With a population of over 40,000,000, it is Indonesia's second most populated province.

    The province is home to Surabaya, the nation's second largest city, as well as some very popular tourist destinations like Malang, Mount Bromo, Kawah Ijen or Banyuwangi. It is known for its stunning nature and easy accessability from Bali. With Surabaya, the province also plays an important role in many of the fast growing industries in Indonesia, like the technology or financial sector. It is one of the country's most important transportation hubs, since it is home to the second busiest harbor in all of Indonesia.

    Malang serves as one of the most popular tourist destinations in the province because of its close proximity to many of the beautiful tourist attractions nature has to offer. Some of the most popular among them are without any doubt Mount Bromo and Kawah Ijen. The 2 volcanos are visited by many tourists every day because of the good connections to main roads and stunning sights they offer.
