    The Amazon rainforest is known for it's biodiversity and untouched nature. What if I were to tell you, that there is a national park with a rainforest, that is even older and with more biodiversity? Does that sound tempting? That National Park actually exist and it goes under the name of "Khao Sok" National Park.

    Is it as cool as it sounds and is it worth going there? That's what we are going to find out in this post. We're going to talk about accomodations, jungle trekking, tours and of course the beautiful nature and unique animals that can be found here.

    ## About Khao Sok

    The Khao Sok National Park is arguably one of Thailand's most beautiful National Parks. It was established in 1980 and draws about half a million visitors every year. Its area is about 750km², 165km² of which are occupied by the Cheow Lan lake, which is contained by the Ratchapraphra Dam. It is located in the Surat Thani Province in southern Thailand.

    The national park is known for its impressive sandstone cliffs and biodiversity in the rain forest. Thanks to the big area, the national park can hold the many tourists, that visit it every year without taking too much damage. Most of the park is untouched nature with only few trails running trough it. 

    The park is estimated to contain over 5 percent of the world's wildlife species (which is a lot). Wild mammals include the Asian elephant, tiger, sambar deer, bear, white headed gibbons and barking deer. The flora in the park is also very diverse. The whole national park (expcept the lake and the cliffs) is covered in thick rainforest consisting of Bamboo, many different tree species and lianas. There are also many kinds of wild fruit to be found in the park. Khao Sok National Park is perhaps most well known for the [*Bua Phut*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia_kerrii).

    The Ratchapraphra dam is one of the biggest power plants of the country. It was build with the intention to power the whole of southern Thailand. And while the construction of the dam resulted in the flooding and thus the destruction of a huge area of rain forest, the created lake leads to new opportunities not only in tourism, but also in biodiversity, since it holds a lot of fish.

    ## My experiences in Khao Sok

    ### Traveling to Khao Sok

    I took the bus from Phuket town to Khao Sok. I did not know if there where any buses though and I didn't have anything booked. I just went to the Bus Terminal 2 in Phuket, went to the ticket office and told them, that I wanted to go to Khao Sok. Luckily for me, there was a bus going in the right direction and for about 40 Baht I could get on it. The bus took me to Phang Nga Bus station, where I had to wait for about 30 minutes until a minivan to Khao Sok picked me up. I don't know if I was just lucky to find that connection from Phuket to Khao Sok or if it is actually really easy to find one.

    The first bus took about 2 hours and the mini van 3 hours. I arrived in Khao Sok at 7pm and payed about 350 Baht for transportation. Contrary to a bus ticket, I already had my accomodation booked. I stayed in the [Jungle Hostel](https://www.booking.com/Share-bGpCkOL). Khao Sok village is not big and therefore finding your accomodation is very easy. Even more so, because the Jungle Hostel is located in the centre of the village. As far as I'm aware the Hostel only has one dorm, but if you get a spot in it, you will have a great time there. The staff is nice and willing to help you when you have questions, it's pretty cheap and everything is pretty nice. You can also book tours at the front desk of the hostel.

    ### Khao Sok

    For the first day, I booked a jungle trekking tour through the rain forest with a guide.
