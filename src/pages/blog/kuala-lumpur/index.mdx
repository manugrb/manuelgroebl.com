    Unfortunately Kuala Lumpur was the only place I saw in Malaysia. I was really impressed and surprised with this city though. It was way different from what I would have expected it to be like. In the following, I will compare the city to some of the other huge cities and capitals, I've seen in Southeast Asia, as well as to some western cities. I will also tell you about my experiences in this magnificent place and give you some recommendations for when you are going on your own.

    ## About Kuala Lumpur

    Kuala Lumpur is actually a pretty new city. It was established in 1857 as a city to serve the nearby tin mines. Later it became the founding capital of Federation of Malaysia. In recent years, it underwent rapid development and growth. Nowadays the metropolitan area has a population of about 7,500,000 and is still rapidly growing.

    The city is the cultural and economical centre of the country. With a HDI of 0.867 and a GDP of close to 32,000$ per capita (as of April 2023), the city has a very high quality of life and a very strong economy in comparison to most other cities in Southeast Asia. The City placed very high in Technology innovation rankings in Southeast Asia. [^1]

    It is also very popular with tourists. The city was the 6th-most visited in 2019.[^2] It is known for the famous Petronas Towers, which are the highest twin towers in the world, as well as its shopping centres. 3 of the 10 biggest shopping centres are located in Kuala Lumpur. [^3]
