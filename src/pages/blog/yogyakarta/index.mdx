    The first thing I noticed when I arrived in Yogyakarta was that there are many [Bules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bule_(term)) (local term for foreigners). That went on when I got to the hostel. There were toursits there than I have met in the whole of Indonesia up to that point (event though, I have stayed in Hostels before). I quite enjoyed it though, because I could finally exchange experiences with other people, who did exactly the same. I stayed in the [Wonderloft Hostel](https://www.hostelworld.com/st/hostels/p/305155/wonderloft-hostel-jogja/) and I can wholeheartedly recommend to everyone who is backpacking and wants to visit Yogyakarta. Shortly after I arrived, we (about 8 people from the hostel) went out to grab some dinner. Going out for dinner together was also something I really enjoyed, since I had to eat alone pretty much every time so far.

    The next morning 5 others from the hostel and me rented some scooters and went to a [waterfall](https://goo.gl/maps/gUEAKFe3h1ZwaUJB7) near the city. The drive to the waterfall took about 1 hour. It was very scenic and traffic was not too bad so it was actually pretty nice. The waterfall itself is really cool. The water is bright blue and just the perfect temperature. You can stand directly below the waterfall or jump from a platform into a deep part of the river. I really enjoyed this place. After spending about 1.5 hours there, we left again and headed towards the ocean. The drive was again really beautiful. After getting some lunch at a small shop at the shore, we went to the beach with black sand. The beach is on the south shore of Java. There are thousands of miles of open ocean that way, so the waves are quite high. We went in anyways though. It was managable but you had to be careful not to be sucked into the sea. We left the shore before sunset, because driving outside the city at night is not fun because of all the crazy bus drivers. When we got back to the hostel, we showered and got some food. 

    Most of the people, I spend the day with had to leave that evening unfortunately, so the next day I did not have many people to do stuff with. So I just decided to explore the city on my own. And to be honest, in my opinion Jogja is really nothing special. All of the big attractions or places of interest, I was to where kind of boring. It was interesting to just look around the city and try some of the streetfood though. When I got back to the hostel, I met some new people. 

    The next day, I rented a scooter again and explored the surroundings of Jogja again with 2 others from the hostel.
