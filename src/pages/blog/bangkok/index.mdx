    When traveling southeast Asia, you won't be able to go to Bangkok at least once. Bangkok is just *the* central metropolis for everything in the region. In my opinion, being forced to go to Bangkok is not necessarily a bad thing though. It's one of the most vibrant cities I've ever been to and there is so much to explore here. In this post I will talk about my experiences in Thailand's capital and give you some advice about what you should and shouldn't do. I will also talk about why Bangkok is in my opinion the least Thai place I've been to in Thailand.

    ## About Bangkok

    Bangkok is Thailand's capital and with a population of close to 15,000,000 in the metro region, by far the biggest city in Thailand. The city is by far the most important centre for the national economy. It is an important regional force in finance, business and pop culture. It's an international hub for transport and healthcare.

    Many rankings consider Bangkok to be the most visited city in the world. It is known for its cultural landmarks like temples or the Grand Palace, as well as the nightlife and the corresponding red-light districts.

    The first settlers settled down in what now is Bangkok in the 15th century. Back than it was a trading post, which grew and became the site of the capital in 1768. The city has since been the centre of modernization and politics in Siam, which later became Thailand.
