    # Why this Blog post is really cool

    This Blog post is really cool because it is the very first blog post on my personal website. And so on... What am I supposed to write here? I'm just going to keep writing, because I need a really long example text. I hope that is enough, because I don't know what else to write here...

    This piece of code proves, that this blog post is the coolest:

    ```
        print('this is cool')
    ```

</BlogPost>
