summary: "Do you know anyone who does not like french fries? Me neither. Everyone likes french fries. With travel locations this is different most of times. Everyone has their own preference when choosing a holiday location. Some like cities, other might like beautiful nature. Some might like partying while others enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. Because of that fact, I was extremely surprised to find out, that Chian Mai seems to be a destination everyone enjoys. Just like french fries."
