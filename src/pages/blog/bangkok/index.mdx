slug: /bangkok/
summary: "If you are traveling to southeast Asia, you will probably not get around going to Bangkok. In my opinion that's not a bad thing though, because it's one of the most vibrant cities, I've ever been to and there is a lot to explore here. In this post I will talk about my experiences here and give you some advice about what you should and shouldn't do. I will also talk about why Bangkok is in my opinion the least Thai place I've been to in Thailand."
