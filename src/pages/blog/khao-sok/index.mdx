    ## About Khao Sok

    The Khao Sok National Park is arguably one of Thailand's most beautiful National Parks. It was established in 1980 and draws about half a million visitors every year. Its area is about 750km², 165km² of which are occupied by the Cheow Lan lake, which is contained by the Ratchapraphra Dam. It is located in the Surat Thani Province in southern Thailand.

    The national park is known for its impressive sandstone cliffs and biodiversity in the rain forest. Thanks to the big area, the national park can hold the many tourists, that visit it every year without taking too much damage. Most of the park is untouched nature with only few trails running trough it. 

    The park is estimated to contain over 5 percent of the world's wildlife species (which is a lot). Wild mammals include the Asian elephant, tiger, sambar deer, bear, white headed gibbons and barking deer. The flora in the park is also very diverse. The whole national park (expcept the lake and the cliffs) is covered in thick rainforest consisting of Bamboo, many different tree species and lianas. There are also many kinds of wild fruit to be found in the park. Khao Sok National Park is perhaps most well known for the [*Bua Phut*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia_kerrii).

    The Ratchapraphra dam is one of the biggest power plants of the country. It was build with the intention to power the whole of southern Thailand. And while the construction of the dam resulted in the flooding and thus the destruction of a huge area of rain forest, the created lake leads to new opportunities not only in tourism, but also in biodiversity, since it holds a lot of fish.
