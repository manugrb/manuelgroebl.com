    When traveling southeast Asia, you won't be able to go to Bangkok at least once. Bangkok is just *the* central metropolis for everything in the region. In my opinion, being forced to go to Bangkok is not necessarily a bad thing though. It's one of the most vibrant cities I've ever been to and there is so much to explore here. In this post I will talk about my experiences in Thailand's capital and give you some advice about what you should and shouldn't do. I will also talk about why Bangkok is in my opinion the least Thai place I've been to in Thailand.

    ## About Bangkok

    Bangkok is Thailand's capital and with a population of close to 15,000,000 in the metro region, by far the biggest city in Thailand. The city is by far the most important centre for the national economy. It is an important regional force in finance, business and pop culture. It's an international hub for transport and healthcare.

    Many rankings consider Bangkok to be the most visited city in the world. It is known for its cultural landmarks like temples or the Grand Palace, as well as the nightlife and the corresponding red-light districts.

    The first settlers settled down in what now is Bangkok in the 15th century. Back than it was a trading post, which grew and became the site of the capital in 1768. The city has since been the centre of modernization and politics in Siam, which later became Thailand.

    ## My experience in Bangkok

    ### Traveling to Bangkok

    Unsurprisingly, it si really easy to travel to Bangkok. There are tons of trains, buses, fights and ferries going to the city. What might be a bit more challenging is getting to where you want to go in Bangkok. When you know how, even that gets really easy. The public transport in Bangkok is really great. You can choose between 8 urban rail lines and dozens of bus lines. The subway goes around all the important parts of the city and it does it fast and for a pretty low price.
    
    This massive amount of options, makes it a bit complicated to choose the right option and find your train / bus. Luckily all of the signs have an english translation and therefore are easy for a foreigner to understand. Once you understand the general system of the public transport in the city it gets really easy to get around. Buying tickets is also really easy even if you don't have a commuter card. In that case you will get a free token, that you will have to give away when you are at your destination. This system is in my opinion better than the ones I have seen in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, where you sometimes have to buy a commuter card in order to be able to use the public transport.

    Finding your destination in some parts of the city might be a bit tricky as well. My hostel for example was in the middle of china town behind all of the markets in a small street and was therefore not very easy to find. Looking for it was a nice experience though, because Bangkok's china town felt more like china than any china town I had seen up to that point.

    ### China Town

    My first hostel in Bangkok was in China Town, which itself is located pretty centrally in the city. Bangkok's China Town was by far the best I have seen anywhere in southeast Asia up to that point. Not only was the food they sold chinese, but also the architecture and the houses around here were really chinese. I really liked the tight walking streets between multi-story buildings with dozens of shops selling everything from little snacks to toys.

    China Town is especially nice at night, although it gets really crowded. As soon as the sun goes down, all of the food stalls are being built in the streets. At around 8pm china town is full of people selling food and people wanting to buy said food. I've seen one of the broadest selections of foods in that market and all of the food I tried tasted really good.

    The only thing I really disliked about China Town was that it felt way too commercialized. There were pretty much only tourists in the streets and all of the food was really expensive (for southeast Asia that is).
