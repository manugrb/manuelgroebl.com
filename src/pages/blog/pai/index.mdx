    If you read up on Pai before going there, you might expect to arrive in a city full of hippies and magic mushrooms between the mountains, but you will also have found out, that the town is a popular tourist destination. So how does a quiet hippie mountain village and heaps of tourists mix? Let's find out.

    ## About Pai

    Officially, Pai is a small town. In population if had a population of just over 2000. Unfortunately I could not find any newer numbers, but it might be a lot more now. The town is about 150km northwest of Chiang Mai and near the Myanmar border.

    Pai was once a quiet and traditional market village. It's culture is influenced by Myanmar. At some point however, Pai started to get popular for tourists. At first it was a lot of hippies who came to the town. That's where Pai got it's hippie reputation from. Not long after that, Pai started appearing on many tourism maps. That's when it started to get really popular. From that point on not only hippies but also a lot of backpackers visit the town every year.

    The town has since adopted to its new circumstances. There are many bars with life music and hostels as well as luxury apartments for all kind of travelers. There are also multiple 7-Elevens in town. Many tourists are foreigners, but after some popular Thai movies were filmed in the town, the number of domestic tourists also greatly increased.
