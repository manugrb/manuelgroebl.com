Do you know anyone who does not like french fries? Me neither. Everyone like them. With travel destinations it's different. Everyone has their own preference and expectations for their perfect location. Some like cities, while others might prefer beautiful nature. Some might like partying and nightlife, while others enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. Therefore, I was very surprised to find out, that Chiang Mai seems to be a location (almost) everybody really likes. Just like french fries. In this post I will explain why that is and give you some advice on things that you should and should not do.

## About Chiang Mai

Chiang Mai is Thailand's second largest city. The city itself only has a population of about 130,000, but the expanded city area has a population of just short of 1.2 million.fact

The city is located in the north of Thailand in a mountainous region called the *Thai Highlands*. Although the name might suggest, that the city is at a pretty high elevation, the average elevation is still just about 310m. Nonetheless, the climate is a lot more bearable than in the south of Thailand. It is cooler for large portions of the year, and while it does get hotter in Chiang Mai during dry season than in the south of Thailand, it's not nearly as humid and therefore a lot more comfortable.

The city was founded in 1296 and has been serving as the capital of the kingdom of [Lan Na](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lan_Na) until its fall. Nowadays it serves as the capital of the Chiang Mai province. The city has therefore always played an important historical role. This fact is underlined by the huge amount of ancient buildings and cultural highlights, that can be found around the city.

## My experience in Chiang Mai

### Traveling to Chiang Mai

Thanks to its size, traveling to Chiang Mai is very easy. There are tons of buses and trains going to the city from all over the country and also from other countries every day. I took the sleeper train from Bangkok, which took about 13 hours, but was one of the best train experiences I ever had. For about 20€ I booked a 2nd class sleeper ticket. For your money you get a literal bed with sheets, a blanket some pillows and curtains for privacy. The bed is not small and very comfortable. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that if you get the upper bunk bed, you do not have access to a window, but since I got a lower bunk bed, I really enjoyed my ride and got some very nice sleep.

As it seems to be common in Thailand, the train station in Chiang Mai was not in the city center. However it was only a few kilometers away, so I could just walk to my hostel. I stayed in the [TT Hostel](https://www.booking.com/Share-jELtwV), which might have been the best hostel I ever stayed at. Sky the owner was super nice and helpful. She told me about all the best places and gave me important information about the surroundings of Chiang Mai. I think she represents the people of Chiang Mai very well. (Almost) everyone I met in Chiang Mai was just super relaxed and extremely kind.
