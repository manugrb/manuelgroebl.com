    The first thing I noticed when I arrived in Yogyakarta was that there are many [Bules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bule_(term)) (local term for foreigners). That went on when I got to the hostel. There were tourists there than I have met in the whole of Indonesia up to that point (event though, I have stayed in Hostels before). I quite enjoyed it though, because I could finally exchange experiences with other people, who did exactly the same. I stayed in the [Wonderloft Hostel](https://www.hostelworld.com/st/hostels/p/305155/wonderloft-hostel-jogja/) and I can wholeheartedly recommend to everyone who is backpacking and wants to visit Yogyakarta. Shortly after I arrived, we (about 8 people from the hostel) went out to grab some dinner. Going out for dinner together was also something I really enjoyed, since I had to eat alone pretty much every time so far.

    The next morning 5 others from the hostel and me rented some scooters and went to a [waterfall](https://goo.gl/maps/gUEAKFe3h1ZwaUJB7) near the city. The drive to the waterfall took about 1 hour. It was very scenic and traffic was not too bad so it was actually pretty nice. The waterfall itself is really cool. The water is bright blue and just the perfect temperature. You can stand directly below the waterfall or jump from a platform into a deep part of the river. I really enjoyed this place. After spending about 1.5 hours there, we left again and headed towards the ocean. The drive was again really beautiful. After getting some lunch at a small shop at the shore, we went to the beach with black sand. The beach is on the south shore of Java. There are thousands of miles of open ocean that way, so the waves are quite high. We went in anyways though. It was manageable but you had to be careful not to be sucked into the sea. We left the shore before sunset, because driving outside the city at night is not fun because of all the crazy bus drivers. When we got back to the hostel, we showered and got some food.

    Most of the people, I spend the day with had to leave that evening unfortunately, so the next day I did not have many people to do stuff with. So I just decided to explore the city on my own. And to be honest, in my opinion Jogja is really nothing special. All of the big attractions or places of interest, I was to where kind of boring. It was interesting to just look around the city and try some of the street food though. When I got back to the hostel, I met some new people. 

    The next day, I rented a scooter again and explored the surroundings of Jogja again with 2 others from the hostel. We again went to the mountains in the west. We were caught in some rain though, which was not to bad because that way it wasn't that hot. After going to the same waterfall I had already been at, we left the mountains behind and headed south. We drove over small and calm roads and could therefore enjoy the beautiful landscapes around us. We got something to eat near the shore and then headed back, because again, we didn't want to drive back at night.

    Something you hear from everywhere, that you need to visit when you are in Yogyakarta is the Buddhist temple. There are 2 big temples outside of the city. One of them (the [Borobudur temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur)) is the world's largest Buddhist temple. Therefore, I decided to go visit them. Me and 3 others from the hostel rented a [grab](https://www.grab.com) driver for the whole day to get to both temples. The tickets are really expensive though. An adult has to pay 45$ for the entry to both temples. We visited Borobudur first. It was pretty impressive but there was not too much to do there, so after about 1 hour, we left again and headed to Prambanan. This one, I would say is quite a lot nicer. We were actually able to go inside and it looks a lot cooler as well. For my taste though, there were still way too many tourists and way to little to do there. After like 1.5 hours we left again and headed back to the hostel. Most of the time of the day was actually spent driving.

    Therefore all in all I would say visiting the Buddhist temples in Jogja might not be worth it for you. There are so many more things to do that are more fun and also a lot cheaper. Also you can only really see the temples. There are no Buddhists there to talk to and learn something from.

    That was unfortunately already my last day in Jogja. I spent the rest of the evening at the hostel socializing with other backpackers and then took the night train to Malang.
