  After I skipped Bali when I was in Indonesia, I felt that I had to catch up on the partying experience in Southeast Asia. Because of that and also because of the great location of Phuket, I decided to start my travels in Thailand here. I normally don't really like parties and am more interested in the areas, where tourists don't go as often. In the following, I will tell you a bit about my experience in Phuket and what you can do the island besides partying.   

  ## About Phuket

  First, I have to mention, that Phuket is in fact pronounced "Puket" not "Fuket". That is something that I was unsure about when I arrived there and since then have seen many people get wrong.

  Phuket is Thailand's biggest island. However Phuket also refers to the province containing Phuket island (and 32 others), as well as the city Phuket (often referred to as Phuket Town), which is also the Province's capital and biggest city. The province has an area of about 600km², which is slightly less than Singapore's.

  Being located on the main travel route between India and China, the island has always been important for trading. It was also a destination of interest for Portuguese, French, Dutch and English traders. Surprisingly though, it has never been colonized by any european power. The province has been a very wealthy one in the past because of its access to tin and rubber. Nowadays, the province is still one of Thailand's wealthiest per population, only that nowadays the wealth comes from tourism.

  Phuket island is connected to Thailand's mainland with the "Sarasin Bridge". Therefore getting to and from the Island is pretty easy and there are many daily buses to all kinds of destinations around mainland Thailand. Phuket International Airport is also one of the busiest in Thailand. Lastly, there are also dozens of destinations reachable by ferry.

  ## My experience in Phuket
  
  ### Arriving in Phuket'
  
  I took a flight to Phuket and landed at the Phuket International Airport. My first Hostel on the island was in Phuket town, which is about 40km away from the Airport. Getting there is really easy but not very cheap. Phuket is not one of the main touristic places on the island. Therefore most buses and minivans don't go there. I ordered a taxi, but I now know, that there are also some minivans if you just look for long enough.

  The taxi ride took about an hour and the driver immediately started to try to sell me some stuff. He told me about all the islands near Phuket and how I should book a ferry to them, then parked outside a tourist office and insisted, that I should go in with him. In there I had to convince the lady, that I did not want to book any tours for like half an hour. After that I got dropped of at the front door of my Hostel and payed about 20€, which is not too bad for a 1h drive.

  Arriving in Phuket town was pretty pleasant. My Hostel was the "Neighbor's Hostel" in the old town. The area is really beautiful with some nice houses, architecture, walking streets and markets really close by. I could not help but notice, that most people walking around where tourists.
