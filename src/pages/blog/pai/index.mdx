    If you read up on Pai before going there, you might expect to arrive in a city full of hippies and magic mushrooms between the mountains, but you will also have found out, that the town is a popular tourist destination. So how does a quiet hippie mountain village and heaps of tourists mix? Let's find out.

    ## About Pai

    Officially, Pai is a small town. In population if had a population of just over 2000. Unfortunately I could not find any newer numbers, but it might be a lot more now. The town is about 150km northwest of Chiang Mai and near the Myanmar border.

    Pai was once a quiet and traditional market village. It's culture is influenced by Myanmar. At some point however, Pai started to get popular for tourists. At first it was a lot of hippies who came to the town. That's where Pai got it's hippie reputation from. Not long after that, Pai started appearing on many tourism maps. That's when it started to get really popular. From that point on not only hippies but also a lot of backpackers visit the town every year.

    The town has since adopted to its new circumstances. There are many bars with life music and hostels as well as luxury apartments for all kind of travelers. There are also multiple 7-Elevens in town. Many tourists are foreigners, but after some popular Thai movies were filmed in the town, the number of domestic tourists also greatly increased.

    ## My experience in Pai

    ### Traveling to Pai

    You might think, that getting to such a small village as Pai is one, might be difficult. However you have to keep in mind, that it is one of the most popular tourist destination in north Thailand. Therefore getting to Pai is very easy. You can probably book a van from Chiang Mai to Pai with your hostel. They are really cheap too. I paid 200 Baht (~5€) for mine, which is really impressive considering that you are riding in a comfortable van with max. 10 other people for about 3 hours.

    Many people also rent a scooter and ride it to Pai and back. If you like riding scooters, that might be worth it too. The road between the two places is very beautiful and as long as you don't go in the main touristic season, it's not very crowded either. You should keep in mind, that renting a scooter in Chiang Mai is considerably more expensive than renting one in Pai though. There is also an option to rent a scooter in Pai and return it in Chiang Mai. Therefore you might want to consider to take the van to Pai and then ride back to Chiang Mai with a scooter.

    Getting around Pai is no problem. The town is small enough, that you can reach everything on foot. You might want to pay attention, that you don't book a hostel that's far outside of the town, since there are a few of them like the *crazy monkey hostel*, which I generally don't recommend.

    ### Pai

    Despite it's reputation as a small and sleepy town, Pai has a lot of things to offer. For a town that size, there is extremely much nightlife. There are dozens of bars with life music. There are also a few clubs. Every night there is a night market in the city center, which is very obviously directed towards tourists. You can buy souvenirs, get your hair done or get some street food. Obviously there are also a lot of shops, that sell weed all around the town.

    The countless tourist offices have a large variety of tours you can do. I did not do any, so I can not comment on whether they are worth it or not. Some of the most popular things are canyoning in the Pai canyon or visiting some waterfalls nearby. Another tourist activity Pai is known for is tipsy tubing. Everyone I met who has been to Pai did tipsy tubing. Most of them seemed to have enjoyed it, but it does apparently get very crowded. Personally I did not do it and I have to say that I don't miss it. There are just so many other cool things to do in Pai.

    Pai is a pretty great place to get some nice food. You can get some traditional north Thai food or you can get food from all over the world. Pai has so many restaurants, that it's really hard choosing one. You should also be careful, because some of them are really overpriced (especially the ones selling western food).

    ### Pai's surroundings

    As I have touched on before, Pai is surrounded by mountains. The general area around Pai is also not very densely populated. Therefore there is a lot of untouched nature to see. There is so much hiking to do in the area, that you will most likely not have time to do all of it. You just have to be careful about planing routes with some trails, because many trails that look good on the map don't actually exist or are in very bad condition.

    The first [hike](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1084682112?share_token=a0kRU7L042OuKfY1Mm3ahhEsWSMyUxNTwre14Gt6zYtr2V7t3R&ref=wtd) I did was to a waterfall near the town. The great thing about it is that you can do it directly from the town center. You don't need to rent a scooter and drive somewhere first. The walk itself is very beautiful, since you are constantly going through the jungle along a little stream, which you have to cross quite often though. For me that was not a big problem, because I did it at the end of dry season, when the stream is probably carrying the least water. But that's something to keep in mind if you want to do the hike in rainy season.

    The waterfall itself is really nice and definitely worth the effort. Something I also really liked about the hike is, that there where barely any people there. Nonetheless the trail was still in good condition. You should be a bit careful about snakes though, because I got really scared by a big boy, who slithered away from me just half a meter in front of me and there are some deathly venomous snakes in the area.

    The other [hike](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1085683224?share_token=aXX5KiWGkhV2qdFg65VK7ym4N2kXdX450ImtoAjCnnCc9bq1YK&ref=wtd) I did was not as cool. It passes by the big buddha statue, that watches over the value, which is really cool, but that's about it. My plan was to hike up some mountain to get a nice view of the valley, and while the view probably would have been nice, I did not make it to the top of the mountain, because the trail just disappeared half way up the mountain. There are some other trails up the mountain thought, so if you are interested, you might try the other trails up.

    ## Is it morally wrong to go to Pai?

    When visiting Pai as a tourist, you are obviously supporting the tourism industry in the region. However, you are also causing the destruction and displacement of culture and traditions, that are over 5000 years old.

    Pai does not feel like a small sleepy village at all. There are no local traditions to be seen there at all. Everything was replaced with luxury accommodations and bars. As far as I know, most of this tourism infrastructure is owned by only a handful of people.

    At the end of the day, you are still supporting locals with your money when you go there and I don't want to tell anyone to do, but now that I know all of these things, I have to say, that I would consider going to Pai again morally wrong.

    In my opinion giving tons of money to a few lucky people, who saw had the opportunity to make a lot of money from the town (some of whom are even western companies), is not worth completely destroying and displacing the culture and traditions, that have been practiced there for thousands of years. Not to mention the families, who have been living there for hundreds of years and are now forced to live elsewhere, because they can't work in tourism and everything around the town got way too expensive for them.

    Please be advised, that I am not informed enough to talk about this topic in depth, so take what I have just said with a grain of salt and do your own research before you go, so that you can figure out on your own, if you consider it morally okay to go there or not.
