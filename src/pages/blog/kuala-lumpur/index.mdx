    Unfortunately Kuala Lumpur was the only place I saw in Malaysia. I was really impressed and surprised with this city though. It was way different from what I would have expected it to be like. In the following, I will compare the city to some of the other huge cities and capitals, I've seen in Southeast Asia, as well as to some western cities. I will also tell you about my experiences in this magnificent place and give you some recommendations for when you are going on your own.

    ## About Kuala Lumpur

    Kuala Lumpur is actually a pretty new city. It was established in 1857 as a city to serve the nearby tin mines. Later it became the founding capital of Federation of Malaysia. In recent years, it underwent rapid development and growth. Nowadays the metropolitan area has a population of about 7,500,000 and is still rapidly growing.

    The city is the cultural and economical centre of the country. With a HDI of 0.867 and a GDP of close to 32,000$ per capita (as of April 2023), the city has a very high quality of life and a very strong economy in comparison to most other cities in Southeast Asia. The City placed very high in Technology innovation rankings in Southeast Asia. [^1]

    It is also very popular with tourists. The city was the 6th-most visited in 2019.[^2] It is known for the famous Petronas Towers, which are the highest twin towers in the world, as well as its shopping centres. 3 of the 10 biggest shopping centres are located in Kuala Lumpur. [^3]

    ## My experience in Kuala Lumpur
    
    ### Arriving in Kuala Lumpur

    I traveled to Kuala Lumpur via plane. I landed at the international airport and was a bit worried, that it might be hard to get to the city, since the airport is about 65km away from the city centre. My concerns, however where unjustified, since the airport is connected to the city very well. There are multiple ways to get to the city. The fastest I know of, though is taking the KLIA Ekspres. Its only purpose is to get people to and from the airport in as little time as possible and it's really good at that. From KLIA 2 (terminal 2) to KL Sentral (central station) it only takes about 30 minutes. From the central stations, you have countless options to get to your destination around KL. All in all, the public transport is really good in KL and unlike anything I have seen in any Southeast Asian cities so far.

    The city unsurprisingly has a big-city-feeling, but the people I met, where still pretty nice - even if they seemed to be stressed a lot of the time - for example, when I got lost at the train station, because there were so many options of trains to take, a random guy approached me and asked me if I needed any help. He then proceeded to explain to me how the public transport in KL works and how to buy a ticket.

    One of the things, that were among the first I noticed, was that the people seem to be pretty diverse in this city. I saw a lot of different ethnicities everywhere and of the locals actually spoke english with each other, probably because it's the only language all of them speak.

    ### China Town

    My first Hostel in KL was in the centre of China Town. Unlike in Surabaya (Indonesia), China Town in KL, actually felt and looked like China Town. There were thousands of street markets and great Chinese restaurants. Also the people and many of the houses look Chinese. It is exactly how you would imagine China Town to be like.

    Over the whole of China Town towers the incredibly impressive [Merdeka 118](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118), which - with the height of 680m - is the second highest building of the world (as of April 2023). It is located at the edge of China Town and because of it's height visible from everywhere in the district. Another place worth visiting in China Town is the River of Life, which is simply the river flowing through this part of the city. But at night the river is illuminated in bright colors, and there is artificially created mist glowing in the same colors. This place is perfect for a nice walk along the river after sunset.

    ### City Center

    The second hostel I stayed at was close to the city centre. It was actually really cool. It is situated in the 34th floor and has a roof terrace with some incredible views. The name of the Hostel is [Penthouse on 34](https://www.booking.com/hotel/my/penthouse-on-34.html). I can definitely recommend this hostel. It's a bit more pricey, than others, but with about 10€ a night still absolutely fine. What you get for your money, however is really great. You get access to the roof terrace, most likely a room with a great view and free access to an infinity pool on the 36th floor as well.

    If you are in Kuala Lumpur, you just about have to visit the Petronas Towers. They are like the Eiffel Tower of KL. You can actually even go into the towers and enjoy the great views (I didn't do it but it might be worth it). The Petronas Towers are also very conveniently situated in the centre of the city. There are skyscrapers in every direction. You can explore the KLCC park, which is kind of the Malaysian version of the Central Park in New York, because it's a big and beautiful park between skyscrapers.

    In my opinion, one of the coolest things to do in KL is to just walk between the huge skyscrapers. From there the Menara Kuala Lumpur is easily accessible. It's a huge tower with a view platform at the top. It's also build on a hill, which makes it look even taller. For about 10€ you can get a ticket to the top. Unfortunately for me, the weather was quite bad when I was there and most of the cool things were therefore not operating. I did not go up, but I think with some nice weather, it might really be worth it because the view from up there must be really good.

    I would plan in at least 1 day just to explore the skyscrapers and skyline of KL.
